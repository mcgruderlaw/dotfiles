DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     ttmmuuxx is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and
     controlled from a single screen.  ttmmuuxx may be detached from a screen and continue running in the
     background, then later reattached.

     When ttmmuuxx is started it creates a new _s_e_s_s_i_o_n with a single _w_i_n_d_o_w and displays it on screen.  A
     status line at the bottom of the screen shows information on the current session and is used to
     enter interactive commands.

     A session is a single collection of _p_s_e_u_d_o _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l_s under the management of ttmmuuxx.  Each session
     has one or more windows linked to it.  A window occupies the entire screen and may be split into
     rectangular panes, each of which is a separate pseudo terminal (the pty(7) manual page documents
     the technical details of pseudo terminals).  Any number of ttmmuuxx instances may connect to the same
     session, and any number of windows may be present in the same session.  Once all sessions are
     killed, ttmmuuxx exits.

     Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection (such as ssh(1) connection
     timeout) or intentional detaching (with the ‘C-b d’ key strokes).  ttmmuuxx may be reattached using:

           $ tmux attach

     In ttmmuuxx, a session is displayed on screen by a _c_l_i_e_n_t and all sessions are managed by a single
     _s_e_r_v_e_r.  The server and each client are separate processes which communicate through a socket in
     _/_t_m_p.

     The options are as follows:

     --22            Force ttmmuuxx to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.

     --CC            Start in control mode (see the _C_O_N_T_R_O_L _M_O_D_E section).  Given twice (--CCCC) disables
                   echo.

     --cc _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                   Execute _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d using the default shell.  If necessary, the ttmmuuxx server will
                   be started to retrieve the ddeeffaauulltt--sshheellll option.  This option is for compatibility
                   with sh(1) when ttmmuuxx is used as a login shell.

     --ff _f_i_l_e       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default, ttmmuuxx loads the system con‐
                   figuration file from _/_e_t_c_/_t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f, if present, then looks for a user configura‐
                   tion file at _~_/_._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f.

                   The configuration file is a set of ttmmuuxx commands which are executed in sequence
                   when the server is first started.  ttmmuuxx loads configuration files once when the
                   server process has started.  The ssoouurrccee--ffiillee command may be used to load a file
                   later.

                   ttmmuuxx shows any error messages from commands in configuration files in the first
                   session created, and continues to process the rest of the configuration file.

     --LL _s_o_c_k_e_t_-_n_a_m_e
                   ttmmuuxx stores the server socket in a directory under TMUX_TMPDIR, TMPDIR if it is
                   unset, or _/_t_m_p if both are unset.  The default socket is named _d_e_f_a_u_l_t.  This
                   option allows a different socket name to be specified, allowing several independent
                   ttmmuuxx servers to be run.  Unlike --SS a full path is not necessary: the sockets are
                   all created in the same directory.

                   If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the ttmmuuxx
                   server process to recreate it (note that this will fail if any parent directories
                   are missing).

     --ll            Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect and is for compatibil‐
                   ity with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.

     --SS _s_o_c_k_e_t_-_p_a_t_h
                   Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If --SS is specified, the
                   default socket directory is not used and any --LL flag is ignored.

     --uu            ttmmuuxx attempts to guess if the terminal is likely to support UTF-8 by checking the
                   first of the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG environment variables to be set for the
                   string "UTF-8".  This is not always correct: the --uu flag explicitly informs ttmmuuxx
                   that UTF-8 is supported.

                   If the server is started from a client passed --uu or where UTF-8 is detected, the
                   uuttff88 and ssttaattuuss--uuttff88 options are enabled in the global window and session options
                   respectively.

     --vv            Request verbose logging.  This option may be specified multiple times for increas‐
                   ing verbosity.  Log messages will be saved into _t_m_u_x_-_c_l_i_e_n_t_-_P_I_D_._l_o_g and
                   _t_m_u_x_-_s_e_r_v_e_r_-_P_I_D_._l_o_g files in the current directory, where _P_I_D is the PID of the
                   server or client process.

     --VV            Report the ttmmuuxx version.

     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_f_l_a_g_s]
                   This specifies one of a set of commands used to control ttmmuuxx, as described in the
                   following sections.  If no commands are specified, the nneeww--sseessssiioonn command is
                   assumed.

KKEEYY BBIINNDDIINNGGSS
     ttmmuuxx may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’
     (Ctrl-b) by default, followed by a command key.

     The default command key bindings are:

           C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
           C-o         Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
           C-z         Suspend the ttmmuuxx client.
           !           Break the current pane out of the window.
           "           Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
           #           List all paste buffers.

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
     This section contains a list of the commands supported by ttmmuuxx.  Most commands accept the
     optional --tt (and sometimes --ss) argument with one of _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t, _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w,
     or _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e.  These specify the client, session, window or pane which a command should affect.

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t is the name of the pty(7) file to which the client is connected, for example either
     of _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_p_1 or _t_t_y_p_1 for the client attached to _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_p_1.  If no client is specified, ttmmuuxx
     attempts to work out the client currently in use; if that fails, an error is reported.  Clients
     may be listed with the lliisstt--cclliieennttss command.

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n is tried as, in order:

           1.   A session ID prefixed with a $.

           2.   An exact name of a session (as listed by the lliisstt--sseessssiioonnss command).

           3.   The start of a session name, for example ‘mysess’ would match a session named
                ‘mysession’.

           4.   An fnmatch(3) pattern which is matched against the session name.

     If the session name is prefixed with an ‘=’, only an exact match is accepted (so ‘=mysess’ will
     only match exactly ‘mysess’, not ‘mysession’).

     If a single session is found, it is used as the target session; multiple matches produce an
     error.  If a session is omitted, the current session is used if available; if no current session
     is available, the most recently used is chosen.

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w specifies a window in the form _s_e_s_s_i_o_n:_w_i_n_d_o_w.  _s_e_s_s_i_o_n follows the same rules as
     for _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n, and _w_i_n_d_o_w is looked for in order as:

           1.   A special token, listed below.

           2.   A window index, for example ‘mysession:1’ is window 1 in session ‘mysession’.

           3.   A window ID, such as @1.

           4.   An exact window name, such as ‘mysession:mywindow’.

           5.   The start of a window name, such as ‘mysession:mywin’.

           6.   As an fnmatch(3) pattern matched against the window name.

     Like sessions, a ‘=’ prefix will do an exact match only.  An empty window name specifies the next
     unused index if appropriate (for example the nneeww--wwiinnddooww and lliinnkk--wwiinnddooww commands) otherwise the
     current window in _s_e_s_s_i_o_n is chosen.

     The following special tokens are available to indicate particular windows.  Each has a single-
     character alternative form.

     TTookkeenn              MMeeaanniinngg
     {start}       ^    The lowest-numbered window
     {end}         $    The highest-numbered window
     {last}        !    The last (previously current) window
     {next}        +    The next window by number
     {previous}    -    The previous window by number

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e may be a pane ID or takes a similar form to _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w but with the optional addi‐
     tion of a period followed by a pane index or pane ID, for example: ‘mysession:mywindow.1’.  If
     the pane index is omitted, the currently active pane in the specified window is used.  The fol‐
     lowing special tokens are available for the pane index:

     TTookkeenn                  MMeeaanniinngg
     {last}            !    The last (previously active) pane
     {next}            +    The next pane by number
     {previous}        -    The previous pane by number
     {top}                  The top pane
     {bottom}               The bottom pane
     {left}                 The leftmost pane
     {right}                The rightmost pane
     {top-left}             The top-left pane
     {top-right}            The top-right pane
     {bottom-left}          The bottom-left pane
     {bottom-right}         The bottom-right pane
     {up-of}                The pane above the active pane
     {down-of}              The pane below the active pane
     {left-of}              The pane to the left of the active pane
     {right-of}             The pane to the right of the active pane

     The tokens ‘+’ and ‘-’ may be followed by an offset, for example:

           select-window -t:+2

     In addition, _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n, _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w or _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e may consist entirely of the token
     ‘{mouse}’ (alternative form ‘=’) to specify the most recent mouse event (see the _M_O_U_S_E _S_U_P_P_O_R_T
     section) or ‘{marked}’ (alternative form ‘~’) to specify the marked pane (see sseelleecctt--ppaannee --mm).

     Sessions, window and panes are each numbered with a unique ID; session IDs are prefixed with a
     ‘$’, windows with a ‘@’, and panes with a ‘%’.  These are unique and are unchanged for the life
     of the session, window or pane in the ttmmuuxx server.  The pane ID is passed to the child process of
     the pane in the TMUX_PANE environment variable.  IDs may be displayed using the ‘session_id’,
     ‘window_id’, or ‘pane_id’ formats (see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section) and the ddiissppllaayy--mmeessssaaggee,
     lliisstt--sseessssiioonnss, lliisstt--wwiinnddoowwss or lliisstt--ppaanneess commands.

     _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d arguments are sh(1) commands.  This may be a single argument passed to the shell,
     for example:

           new-window 'vi /etc/passwd'

     Will run:

           /bin/sh -c 'vi /etc/passwd'

     Additionally, the nneeww--wwiinnddooww, nneeww--sseessssiioonn, sspplliitt--wwiinnddooww, rreessppaawwnn--wwiinnddooww and rreessppaawwnn--ppaannee commands
     allow _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d to be given as multiple arguments and executed directly (without ‘sh -c’).
     This can avoid issues with shell quoting.  For example:

           $ tmux new-window vi /etc/passwd

     Will run vi(1) directly without invoking the shell.

     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s] refers to a ttmmuuxx command, passed with the command and arguments separately,
     for example:

           bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81

     Or if using sh(1):

           $ tmux bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81

     Multiple commands may be specified together as part of a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e.  Each command should
     be separated by spaces and a semicolon; commands are executed sequentially from left to right and
     lines ending with a backslash continue on to the next line, except when escaped by another back‐
     slash.  A literal semicolon may be included by escaping it with a backslash (for example, when
     specifying a command sequence to bbiinndd--kkeeyy).

     Example ttmmuuxx commands include:

           refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

           rename-session -tfirst newname

           set-window-option -t:0 monitor-activity on

           new-window ; split-window -d

           bind-key R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; \
                   display-message "source-file done"

     Or from sh(1):

           $ tmux kill-window -t :1

           $ tmux new-window \; split-window -d

           $ tmux new-session -d 'vi /etc/passwd' \; split-window -d \; attach

CCLLIIEENNTTSS AANNDD SSEESSSSIIOONNSS
     The ttmmuuxx server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.  Clients are attached to sessions
     to interact with them, either when they are created with the nneeww--sseessssiioonn command, or later with
     the aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn command.  Each session has one or more windows _l_i_n_k_e_d into it.  Windows may be
     linked to multiple sessions and are made up of one or more panes, each of which contains a pseudo
     terminal.  Commands for creating, linking and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in the
     _W_I_N_D_O_W_S _A_N_D _P_A_N_E_S section.

     The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:

     aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn [--ddEErr] [--cc _w_o_r_k_i_n_g_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                   (alias: aattttaacchh)
             If run from outside ttmmuuxx, create a new client in the current terminal and attach it to
             _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n.  If used from inside, switch the current client.  If --dd is specified, any
             other clients attached to the session are detached.  --rr signifies the client is read-only
             (only keys bound to the ddeettaacchh--cclliieenntt or sswwiittcchh--cclliieenntt commands have any effect)

             If no server is started, aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn will attempt to start it; this will fail unless
             sessions are created in the configuration file.

             The _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n rules for aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn are slightly adjusted: if ttmmuuxx needs to
             select the most recently used session, it will prefer the most recently used _u_n_a_t_t_a_c_h_e_d
             session.

             --cc will set the session working directory (used for new windows) to _w_o_r_k_i_n_g_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

             If --EE is used, uuppddaattee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt option will not be applied.

     ddeettaacchh--cclliieenntt [--PP] [--aa] [--ss _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t]
                   (alias: ddeettaacchh)
             Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client specified with --tt, or all clients
             currently attached to the session specified by --ss.  The --aa option kills all but the
             client given with --tt.  If --PP is given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of the client,
             typically causing it to exit.

     hhaass--sseessssiioonn [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                   (alias: hhaass)
             Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist.  If it does
             exist, exit with 0.

     kkiillll--sseerrvveerr
             Kill the ttmmuuxx server and clients and destroy all sessions.

     kkiillll--sseessssiioonn [--aa] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
             Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other sessions, and
             detaching all clients attached to it.  If --aa is given, all sessions but the specified one
             is killed.

     lliisstt--cclliieennttss [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                   (alias: llsscc)
             List all clients attached to the server.  For the meaning of the --FF flag, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S
             section.  If _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n is specified, list only clients connected to that session.

     lliisstt--ccoommmmaannddss
                   (alias: llssccmm)
             List the syntax of all commands supported by ttmmuuxx.

     lliisstt--sseessssiioonnss [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t]
                   (alias: llss)
             List all sessions managed by the server.  For the meaning of the --FF flag, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S
             section.

             Lock _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t, see the lloocckk--sseerrvveerr command.

                   (alias: lloocckkss)
             Lock all clients attached to _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n.

     nneeww--sseessssiioonn [--AAddDDEEPP] [--cc _s_t_a_r_t_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y] [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--nn _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_n_a_m_e] [--ss _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e] [--tt

                   (alias: nneeww)
             Create a new session with name _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e.

             The new session is attached to the current terminal unless --dd is given.  _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_n_a_m_e and
             _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d are the name of and shell command to execute in the initial window.  If --dd
             is used, --xx and --yy specify the size of the initial window (80 by 24 if not given).

             If run from a terminal, any termios(3) special characters are saved and used for new win‐
             dows in the new session.

             The --AA flag makes nneeww--sseessssiioonn behave like aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn if _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e already exists;
             in this case, --DD behaves like --dd to aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn.

             If --tt is given, the new session is _g_r_o_u_p_e_d with _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n.  This means they share
             the same set of windows - all windows from _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n are linked to the new session
             and any subsequent new windows or windows being closed are applied to both sessions.  The
             current and previous window and any session options remain independent and either session
             may be killed without affecting the other.  Giving --nn or _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d are invalid if --tt
             is used.

             The --PP option prints information about the new session after it has been created.  By
             default, it uses the format ‘#{session_name}:’ but a different format may be specified
             with --FF.

             If --EE is used, uuppddaattee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt option will not be applied.  uuppddaattee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt.

                   (alias: rreeffrreesshh)
             Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is given with --tt.
             If --SS is specified, only update the client's status bar.

                   (alias: sshhoowwmmssggss)
             Show client messages or server information.  Any messages displayed on the status line
             are saved in a per-client message log, up to a maximum of the limit set by the
             _m_e_s_s_a_g_e_-_l_i_m_i_t server option.  With --tt, display the log for _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t.  --II, --JJ and --TT

                   (alias: sswwiittcchhcc)
             Switch the current session for client _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t to _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n.  If --ll, --nn or --pp
             is used, the client is moved to the last, next or previous session respectively.  --rr tog‐
             gles whether a client is read-only (see the aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn command).

             If --EE is used, uuppddaattee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt option will not be applied.

             --TT sets the client's key table; the next key from the client will be interpreted from
             _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e.  This may be used to configure multiple prefix keys, or to bind commands to
             sequences of keys.  For example, to make typing ‘abc’ run the lliisstt--kkeeyyss command:

                   bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
                   bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2
                   bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1

WWIINNDDOOWWSS AANNDD PPAANNEESS
     A ttmmuuxx window may be in one of several modes.  The default permits direct access to the terminal
     attached to the window.  The other is copy mode, which permits a section of a window or its his‐
     tory to be copied to a _p_a_s_t_e _b_u_f_f_e_r for later insertion into another window.  This mode is
     entered with the ccooppyy--mmooddee command, bound to ‘[’ by default.  It is also entered when a command
     that produces output, such as lliisstt--kkeeyyss, is executed from a key binding.

     The keys available depend on whether emacs or vi mode is selected (see the mmooddee--kkeeyyss option).
     The following keys are supported as appropriate for the mode:

     The next and previous word keys use space and the ‘-’, ‘_’ and ‘@’ characters as word delimiters
     by default, but this can be adjusted by setting the _w_o_r_d_-_s_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r_s session option.  Next word
     moves to the start of the next word, next word end to the end of the next word and previous word
     to the start of the previous word.  The three next and previous space keys work similarly but use
     a space alone as the word separator.

     The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.  For instance, typing ‘f’ followed by ‘/’
     will move the cursor to the next ‘/’ character on the current line.  A ‘;’ will then jump to the
     next occurrence.

     Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.  With vi key bindings, a pre‐
     fix is entered using the number keys; with emacs, the Alt (meta) key and a number begins prefix
     entry.  For example, to move the cursor forward by ten words, use ‘M-1 0 M-f’ in emacs mode, and
     ‘10w’ in vi.

     Mode key bindings are defined in a set of named tables: _v_i_-_e_d_i_t and _e_m_a_c_s_-_e_d_i_t for keys used when
     line editing at the command prompt; _v_i_-_c_h_o_i_c_e and _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_h_o_i_c_e for keys used when choosing from
     lists (such as produced by the cchhoooossee--wwiinnddooww command); and _v_i_-_c_o_p_y and _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_o_p_y used in copy
     mode.  The tables may be viewed with the lliisstt--kkeeyyss command and keys modified or removed with
     bbiinndd--kkeeyy and uunnbbiinndd--kkeeyy.  If aappppeenndd--sseelleeccttiioonn, ccooppyy--sseelleeccttiioonn, or ssttaarrtt--nnaammeedd--bbuuffffeerr are given
     the --xx flag, ttmmuuxx will not exit copy mode after copying.  ccooppyy--ppiippee copies the selection and
     pipes it to a command.  For example the following will bind ‘C-w’ not to exit after copying and
     ‘C-q’ to copy the selection into _/_t_m_p as well as the paste buffer:

           bind-key -temacs-copy C-w copy-selection -x
           bind-key -temacs-copy C-q copy-pipe "cat >/tmp/out"

     The paste buffer key pastes the first line from the top paste buffer on the stack.

     The synopsis for the ccooppyy--mmooddee command is:

     ccooppyy--mmooddee [--MMeeuu] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e]
             Enter copy mode.  The --uu option scrolls one page up.  --MM begins a mouse drag (only valid
             if bound to a mouse key binding, see _M_O_U_S_E _S_U_P_P_O_R_T).  --ee specifies that scrolling to the
             bottom of the history (to the visible screen) should exit copy mode.  While in copy mode,
             pressing a key other than those used for scrolling will disable this behaviour.  This is
             intended to allow fast scrolling through a pane's history, for example with:

                   bind PageUp copy-mode -eu

     Each window displayed by ttmmuuxx may be split into one or more _p_a_n_e_s; each pane takes up a certain
     area of the display and is a separate terminal.  A window may be split into panes using the
     sspplliitt--wwiinnddooww command.  Windows may be split horizontally (with the --hh flag) or vertically.  Panes
     may be resized with the rreessiizzee--ppaannee command (bound to ‘C-up’, ‘C-down’ ‘C-left’ and ‘C-right’ by
     default), the current pane may be changed with the sseelleecctt--ppaannee command and the rroottaattee--wwiinnddooww and
     sswwaapp--ppaannee commands may be used to swap panes without changing their position.  Panes are numbered
     beginning from zero in the order they are created.

     A number of preset _l_a_y_o_u_t_s are available.  These may be selected with the sseelleecctt--llaayyoouutt command
     or cycled with nneexxtt--llaayyoouutt (bound to ‘Space’ by default); once a layout is chosen, panes within
     it may be moved and resized as normal.

     The following layouts are supported:

     eevveenn--hhoorriizzoonnttaall
             Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

     eevveenn--vveerrttiiccaall
             Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

     mmaaiinn--hhoorriizzoonnttaall
             A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes are spread
             from left to right in the leftover space at the bottom.  Use the _m_a_i_n_-_p_a_n_e_-_h_e_i_g_h_t window
             option to specify the height of the top pane.

     mmaaiinn--vveerrttiiccaall
             Similar to mmaaiinn--hhoorriizzoonnttaall but the large pane is placed on the left and the others spread
             from top to bottom along the right.  See the _m_a_i_n_-_p_a_n_e_-_w_i_d_t_h window option.

     ttiilleedd   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and columns.

     In addition, sseelleecctt--llaayyoouutt may be used to apply a previously used layout - the lliisstt--wwiinnddoowwss com‐
     mand displays the layout of each window in a form suitable for use with sseelleecctt--llaayyoouutt.  For exam‐
     ple:

           $ tmux list-windows
           0: ksh [159x48]
               layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
           $ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}

     ttmmuuxx automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size.  Note that a lay‐
     out cannot be applied to a window with more panes than that from which the layout was originally
     defined.

     Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

     bbrreeaakk--ppaannee [--ddPP] [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--ss _s_r_c_-_p_a_n_e] [--tt _d_s_t_-_p_a_n_e]
                   (alias: bbrreeaakkpp)
             Break _s_r_c_-_p_a_n_e off from its containing window to make it the only pane in _d_s_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w.  If
             --dd is given, the new window does not become the current window.  The --PP option prints
             information about the new window after it has been created.  By default, it uses the for‐
             mat ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may be specified with --FF.

     ccaappttuurree--ppaannee [--aaeeppPPqq] [--bb _b_u_f_f_e_r_-_n_a_m_e] [--EE _e_n_d_-_l_i_n_e] [--SS _s_t_a_r_t_-_l_i_n_e] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e]
                   (alias: ccaappttuurreepp)
             Capture the contents of a pane.  If --pp is given, the output goes to stdout, otherwise to
             the buffer specified with --bb or a new buffer if omitted.  If --aa is given, the alternate
             screen is used, and the history is not accessible.  If no alternate screen exists, an
             error will be returned unless --qq is given.  If --ee is given, the output includes escape
             sequences for text and background attributes.  --CC also escapes non-printable characters
             as octal \xxx.  --JJ joins wrapped lines and preserves trailing spaces at each line's end.
             --PP captures only any output that the pane has received that is the beginning of an as-yet
             incomplete escape sequence.

             --SS and --EE specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first line of the
             visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.  ‘-’ to --SS is the start of
             the history and to --EE the end of the visible pane.  The default is to capture only the
             visible contents of the pane.

     cchhoooossee--cclliieenntt [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w] [_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e]
             Put a window into client choice mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from
             a list.  After a client is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the client pty(7) path in _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e
             and the result executed as a command.  If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is not given, "detach-client -t '%%'"
             is used.  For the meaning of the --FF flag, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section.  This command works
             only if at least one client is attached.

     cchhoooossee--sseessssiioonn [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w] [_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e]
             Put a window into session choice mode, where a session may be selected interactively from
             a list.  When one is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the session name in _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e and the
             result executed as a command.  If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is not given, "switch-client -t '%%'" is used.
             For the meaning of the --FF flag, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section.  This command works only if at
             least one client is attached.

     cchhoooossee--ttrreeee [--ssuuww] [--bb _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_-_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e] [--cc _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e] [--SS _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--WW _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--tt
             _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w]
             Put a window into tree choice mode, where either sessions or windows may be selected
             interactively from a list.  By default, windows belonging to a session are indented to
             show their relationship to a session.

             Note that the cchhoooossee--wwiinnddooww and cchhoooossee--sseessssiioonn commands are wrappers around cchhoooossee--ttrreeee.

             If --ss is given, will show sessions.  If --ww is given, will show windows.

             By default, the tree is collapsed and sessions must be expanded to windows with the right
             arrow key.  The --uu option will start with all sessions expanded instead.

             If --bb is given, will override the default session command.  Note that ‘%%’ can be used
             and will be replaced with the session name.  The default option if not specified is
             "switch-client -t '%%'".  If --cc is given, will override the default window command.  Like
             --bb, ‘%%’ can be used and will be replaced with the session name and window index.  When a
             window is chosen from the list, the session command is run before the window command.

             If --SS is given will display the specified format instead of the default session format.
             If --WW is given will display the specified format instead of the default window format.
             For the meaning of the --ss and --ww options, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section.

             This command works only if at least one client is attached.

     cchhoooossee--wwiinnddooww [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w] [_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e]
             Put a window into window choice mode, where a window may be chosen interactively from a
             list.  After a window is selected, ‘%%’ is replaced by the session name and window index
             in _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e and the result executed as a command.  If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is not given, "select-win‐
             dow -t '%%'" is used.  For the meaning of the --FF flag, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section.  This
             command works only if at least one client is attached.

             Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t.  See the

             Search for the fnmatch(3) pattern _m_a_t_c_h_-_s_t_r_i_n_g in window names, titles, and visible con‐
             tent (but not history).  The flags control matching behavior: --CC matches only visible
             window contents, --NN matches only the window name and --TT matches only the window title.
             The default is --CCNNTT.  If only one window is matched, it'll be automatically selected,
             otherwise a choice list is shown.  For the meaning of the --FF flag, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S sec‐

             Create a new window.  With --aa, the new window is inserted at the next index up from the
             specified _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w, moving windows up if necessary, otherwise _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w is the
             new window location.

             If --dd is given, the session does not make the new window the current window.
             _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w represents the window to be created; if the target already exists an error
             is shown, unless the --kk flag is used, in which case it is destroyed.  _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d is
             the command to execute.  If _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d is not specified, the value of the
             ddeeffaauulltt--ccoommmmaanndd option is used.  --cc specifies the working directory in which the new win‐
             dow is created.

             When the shell command completes, the window closes.  See the rreemmaaiinn--oonn--eexxiitt option to
             change this behaviour.

             The TERM environment variable must be set to “screen” for all programs running _i_n_s_i_d_e
             ttmmuuxx.  New windows will automatically have “TERM=screen” added to their environment, but
             care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up files.

             The --PP option prints information about the new window after it has been created.  By
             default, it uses the format ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may
             be specified with --FF.

             Pipe any output sent by the program in _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e to a shell command.  A pane may only
             be piped to one command at a time, any existing pipe is closed before _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d is
             executed.  The _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d string may contain the special character sequences supported

             already the current window, the command behaves like llaasstt--wwiinnddooww.

             Create a new pane by splitting _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e: --hh does a horizontal split and --vv a vertical
             split; if neither is specified, --vv is assumed.  The --ll and --pp options specify the size of
             the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in cells (for horizontal split), or as a
             percentage, respectively.  The --bb option causes the new pane to be created to the left of
             or above _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e.  All other options have the same meaning as for the nneeww--wwiinnddooww com‐
             mand.

             Swap two panes.  If --UU is used and no source pane is specified with --ss, _d_s_t_-_p_a_n_e is
             swapped with the previous pane (before it numerically); --DD swaps with the next pane
             (after it numerically).  --dd instructs ttmmuuxx not to change the active pane.

             If --ss is omitted and a marked pane is present (see sseelleecctt--ppaannee --mm), the marked pane is
             used rather than the current pane.

             It is an error if no window exists at _s_r_c_-_w_i_n_d_o_w.

             Like sswwaapp--ppaannee, if --ss is omitted and a marked pane is present (see sseelleecctt--ppaannee --mm), the

             the window is linked to only one session, it is unlinked and destroyed.

KKEEYY BBIINNDDIINNGGSS
     ttmmuuxx allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix key.  When specifying
     keys, most represent themselves (for example ‘A’ to ‘Z’).  Ctrl keys may be prefixed with ‘C-’ or
     ‘^’, and Alt (meta) with ‘M-’.  In addition, the following special key names are accepted: _U_p,
     _D_o_w_n, _L_e_f_t, _R_i_g_h_t, _B_S_p_a_c_e, _B_T_a_b, _D_C (Delete), _E_n_d, _E_n_t_e_r, _E_s_c_a_p_e, _F_1 to _F_1_2, _H_o_m_e, _I_C (Insert),
     _N_P_a_g_e_/_P_a_g_e_D_o_w_n_/_P_g_D_n, _P_P_a_g_e_/_P_a_g_e_U_p_/_P_g_U_p, _S_p_a_c_e, and _T_a_b.  Note that to bind the ‘"’ or ‘'’ keys,
     quotation marks are necessary, for example:

           bind-key '"' split-window
           bind-key "'" new-window

     Commands related to key bindings are as follows:

     bbiinndd--kkeeyy [--ccnnrr] [--tt _m_o_d_e_-_t_a_b_l_e] [--TT _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e] _k_e_y _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s]
                   (alias: bbiinndd)
             Bind key _k_e_y to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  Keys are bound in a key table.  By default (without -T), the
             key is bound in the _p_r_e_f_i_x key table.  This table is used for keys pressed after the pre‐
             fix key (for example, by default ‘c’ is bound to nneeww--wwiinnddooww in the _p_r_e_f_i_x table, so ‘C-b
             c’ creates a new window).  The _r_o_o_t table is used for keys pressed without the prefix
             key: binding ‘c’ to nneeww--wwiinnddooww in the _r_o_o_t table (not recommended) means a plain ‘c’ will
             create a new window.  --nn is an alias for --TT _r_o_o_t.  Keys may also be bound in custom key
             tables and the sswwiittcchh--cclliieenntt --TT command used to switch to them from a key binding.  The
             --rr flag indicates this key may repeat, see the rreeppeeaatt--ttiimmee option.

             If --tt is present, _k_e_y is bound in _m_o_d_e_-_t_a_b_l_e: the binding for command mode with --cc or for
             normal mode without.  See the _W_I_N_D_O_W_S _A_N_D _P_A_N_E_S section and the lliisstt--kkeeyyss command for
             information on mode key bindings.

             To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the lliisstt--kkeeyyss command.

             With --tt, the key bindings in _m_o_d_e_-_t_a_b_l_e are listed; this may be one of: _v_i_-_e_d_i_t,
             _e_m_a_c_s_-_e_d_i_t, _v_i_-_c_h_o_i_c_e, _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_h_o_i_c_e, _v_i_-_c_o_p_y or _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_o_p_y.

                   (alias: sseenndd)
             Send a key or keys to a window.  Each argument _k_e_y is the name of the key (such as ‘C-a’
             or ‘npage’ ) to send; if the string is not recognised as a key, it is sent as a series of
             characters.  The --ll flag disables key name lookup and sends the keys literally.  All
             arguments are sent sequentially from first to last.  The --RR flag causes the terminal
             state to be reset.

             --MM passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see _M_O_U_S_E
             _S_U_P_P_O_R_T).

             Send the prefix key, or with --22 the secondary prefix key, to a window as if it was
             pressed.

                   (alias: uunnbbiinndd)
             Unbind the command bound to _k_e_y.  --cc, --nn, --TT and --tt are the same as for bbiinndd--kkeeyy.  If --aa
             is present, all key bindings are removed.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The appearance and behaviour of ttmmuuxx may be modified by changing the value of various options.
     There are three types of option: _s_e_r_v_e_r _o_p_t_i_o_n_s, _s_e_s_s_i_o_n _o_p_t_i_o_n_s and _w_i_n_d_o_w _o_p_t_i_o_n_s.

     The ttmmuuxx server has a set of global options which do not apply to any particular window or ses‐
     sion.  These are altered with the sseett--ooppttiioonn --ss command, or displayed with the sshhooww--ooppttiioonnss --ss
     command.

     In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options, and there is a separate
     set of global session options.  Sessions which do not have a particular option configured inherit
     the value from the global session options.  Session options are set or unset with the sseett--ooppttiioonn
     command and may be listed with the sshhooww--ooppttiioonnss command.  The available server and session
     options are listed under the sseett--ooppttiioonn command.

     Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window, and there is a set of global win‐
     dow options from which any unset options are inherited.  Window options are altered with the
     sseett--wwiinnddooww--ooppttiioonn command and can be listed with the sshhooww--wwiinnddooww--ooppttiioonnss command.  All window
     options are documented with the sseett--wwiinnddooww--ooppttiioonn command.

     ttmmuuxx also supports user options which are prefixed with a ‘@’.  User options may have any name,
     so long as they are prefixed with ‘@’, and be set to any string.  For example:

           $ tmux setw -q @foo "abc123"
           $ tmux showw -v @foo
           abc123

     Commands which set options are as follows:

     sseett--ooppttiioonn [--aaggooqqssuuww] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n | _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w] _o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e
                   (alias: sseett)
             Set a window option with --ww (equivalent to the sseett--wwiinnddooww--ooppttiioonn command), a server
             option with --ss, otherwise a session option.  If --gg is given, the global session or window
             option is set.  The --uu flag unsets an option, so a session inherits the option from the
             global options (or with --gg, restores a global option to the default).

             The --oo flag prevents setting an option that is already set and the --qq flag suppresses
             errors about unknown or ambiguous options.

             With --aa, and if the option expects a string or a style, _v_a_l_u_e is appended to the existing
             setting.  For example:

                   set -g status-left "foo"
                   set -ag status-left "bar"

             Will result in ‘foobar’.  And:

                   set -g status-style "bg=red"
                   set -ag status-style "fg=blue"

             Will result in a red background _a_n_d blue foreground.  Without --aa, the result would be the
             default background and a blue foreground.

             Available window options are listed under sseett--wwiinnddooww--ooppttiioonn.

             _v_a_l_u_e depends on the option and may be a number, a string, or a flag (on, off, or omitted
             to toggle).

             Available server options are:

             bbuuffffeerr--lliimmiitt _n_u_m_b_e_r
                     Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the top of the stack, old
                     ones are removed from the bottom if necessary to maintain this maximum length.

             ddeeffaauulltt--tteerrmmiinnaall _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l
                     Set the default terminal for new windows created in this session - the default
                     value of the TERM environment variable.  For ttmmuuxx to work correctly, this _m_u_s_t be
                     set to ‘screen’, ‘tmux’ or a derivative of them.

             eessccaappee--ttiimmee _t_i_m_e
                     Set the time in milliseconds for which ttmmuuxx waits after an escape is input to
                     determine if it is part of a function or meta key sequences.  The default is 500
                     milliseconds.

             ffooccuuss--eevveennttss [oonn | ooffff]
                     When enabled, focus events are requested from the terminal if supported and
                     passed through to applications running in ttmmuuxx.  Attached clients should be
                     detached and attached again after changing this option.

             mmeessssaaggee--lliimmiitt _n_u_m_b_e_r

                     each client.  The default is 100.

             sseett--cclliippbbooaarrdd [oonn | ooffff]
                     Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the \e]52;...\007 xterm(1)
                     escape sequences.  This option is on by default if there is an _M_s entry in the
                     terminfo(5) description for the client terminal.  Note that this feature needs to
                     be enabled in xterm(1) by setting the resource:

                           disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop

                     Or changing this property from the xterm(1) interactive menu when required.

             tteerrmmiinnaall--oovveerrrriiddeess _s_t_r_i_n_g
                     Contains a list of entries which override terminal descriptions read using
                     terminfo(5).  _s_t_r_i_n_g is a comma-separated list of items each a colon-separated
                     string made up of a terminal type pattern (matched using fnmatch(3)) and a set of
                     _n_a_m_e_=_v_a_l_u_e entries.

                     For example, to set the ‘clear’ terminfo(5) entry to ‘\e[H\e[2J’ for all terminal
                     types and the ‘dch1’ entry to ‘\e[P’ for the ‘rxvt’ terminal type, the option
                     could be set to the string:

                           "*:clear=\e[H\e[2J,rxvt:dch1=\e[P"

                     The terminal entry value is passed through strunvis(3) before interpretation.
                     The default value forcibly corrects the ‘colors’ entry for terminals which sup‐
                     port 256 colours:

                           "*256col*:colors=256,xterm*:XT"

             Available session options are:

                     If keys are entered faster than one in _m_i_l_l_i_s_e_c_o_n_d_s, they are assumed to have
                     been pasted rather than typed and ttmmuuxx key bindings are not processed.  The
                     default is one millisecond and zero disables.

             bbaassee--iinnddeexx _i_n_d_e_x
                     Set the base index from which an unused index should be searched when a new win‐
                     dow is created.  The default is zero.

                     Set action on window bell.  aannyy means a bell in any window linked to a session
                     causes a bell in the current window of that session, nnoonnee means all bells are
                     ignored, ccuurrrreenntt means only bells in windows other than the current window are
                     ignored and ootthheerr means bells in the current window are ignored but not those in
                     other windows.

             bbeellll--oonn--aalleerrtt [oonn | ooffff]

                     Set the command used for new windows (if not specified when the window is cre‐
                     ated) to _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d, which may be any sh(1) command.  The default is an empty
                     string, which instructs ttmmuuxx to create a login shell using the value of the
                     ddeeffaauulltt--sshheellll option.

             ddeeffaauulltt--sshheellll _p_a_t_h
                     Specify the default shell.  This is used as the login shell for new windows when
                     the ddeeffaauulltt--ccoommmmaanndd option is set to empty, and must be the full path of the exe‐
                     cutable.  When started ttmmuuxx tries to set a default value from the first suitable
                     of the SHELL environment variable, the shell returned by getpwuid(3), or _/_b_i_n_/_s_h.
                     This option should be configured when ttmmuuxx is used as a login shell.

                     If on (the default), the client is detached when the session it is attached to is
                     destroyed.  If off, the client is switched to the most recently active of the
                     remaining sessions.

                     command appear.

             ddiissppllaayy--ttiimmee _t_i_m_e
                     Set the amount of time for which status line messages and other on-screen indica‐
                     tors are displayed.  _t_i_m_e is in milliseconds.

             hhiissttoorryy--lliimmiitt _l_i_n_e_s
                     Set the maximum number of lines held in window history.  This setting applies
                     only to new windows - existing window histories are not resized and retain the
                     limit at the point they were created.

                     Lock the session (like the lloocckk--sseessssiioonn command) after _n_u_m_b_e_r seconds of inactiv‐
                     ity.  The default is not to lock (set to 0).

                     Set status line message command style, where _s_t_y_l_e is a comma-separated list of
                     characteristics to be specified.

                     These may be ‘bg=colour’ to set the background colour, ‘fg=colour’ to set the
                     foreground colour, and a list of attributes as specified below.

                     The colour is one of: bbllaacckk, rreedd, ggrreeeenn, yyeellllooww, bblluuee, mmaaggeennttaa, ccyyaann, wwhhiittee, aix‐
                     term bright variants (if supported: bbrriigghhttrreedd, bbrriigghhttggrreeeenn, and so on), ccoolloouurr00
                     to ccoolloouurr225555 from the 256-colour set, ddeeffaauulltt, or a hexadecimal RGB string such
                     as ‘#ffffff’, which chooses the closest match from the default 256-colour set.

                     The attributes is either nnoonnee or a comma-delimited list of one or more of: bbrriigghhtt
                     (or bboolldd), ddiimm, uunnddeerrssccoorree, bblliinnkk, rreevveerrssee, hhiiddddeenn, or iittaalliiccss, to turn an
                     attribute on, or an attribute prefixed with ‘no’ to turn one off.

                     Examples are:

                           fg=yellow,bold,underscore,blink
                           bg=black,fg=default,noreverse

                     With the --aa flag to the sseett--ooppttiioonn command the new style is added otherwise the
                     existing style is replaced.

             mmeessssaaggee--ssttyyllee _s_t_y_l_e
                     Set status line message style.  For how to specify _s_t_y_l_e, see the

             mmoouussee [oonn | ooffff]
                     If on, ttmmuuxx captures the mouse and allows mouse events to be bound as key bind‐
                     ings.  See the _M_O_U_S_E _S_U_P_P_O_R_T section for details.

             mmoouussee--uuttff88 [oonn | ooffff]
                     If enabled, request mouse input as UTF-8 on UTF-8 terminals.

             pprreeffiixx _k_e_y
                     Set the key accepted as a prefix key.

             pprreeffiixx22 _k_e_y
                     Set a secondary key accepted as a prefix key.

             rreennuummbbeerr--wwiinnddoowwss [oonn | ooffff]
                     If on, when a window is closed in a session, automatically renumber the other
                     windows in numerical order.  This respects the bbaassee--iinnddeexx option if it has been
                     set.  If off, do not renumber the windows.

             rreeppeeaatt--ttiimmee _t_i_m_e
                     Allow multiple commands to be entered without pressing the prefix-key again in
                     the specified _t_i_m_e milliseconds (the default is 500).  Whether a key repeats may
                     be set when it is bound using the --rr flag to bbiinndd--kkeeyy.  Repeat is enabled for the
                     default keys bound to the rreessiizzee--ppaannee command.

                     sion.  When this option is true, windows in which the running program has exited
                     do not close, instead remaining open but inactivate.  Use the rreessppaawwnn--wwiinnddooww com‐
                     mand to reactivate such a window, or the kkiillll--wwiinnddooww command to destroy it.

             sseett--ttiittlleess [oonn | ooffff]
                     Attempt to set the client terminal title using the _t_s_l and _f_s_l terminfo(5)
                     entries if they exist.  ttmmuuxx automatically sets these to the \e]0;...\007
                     sequence if the terminal appears to be xterm(1).  This option is off by default.

                     Update the status bar every _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l seconds.  By default, updates will occur
                     every 15 seconds.  A setting of zero disables redrawing at interval.

             ssttaattuuss--kkeeyyss [vvii | eemmaaccss]
                     Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in the status line, for example at the command
                     prompt.  The default is emacs, unless the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables
                     are set and contain the string ‘vi’.

             ssttaattuuss--lleefftt _s_t_r_i_n_g
                     Display _s_t_r_i_n_g (by default the session name) to the left of the status bar.
                     _s_t_r_i_n_g will be passed through strftime(3) and formats (see _F_O_R_M_A_T_S) will be

                     Aggressively resize the chosen window.  This means that ttmmuuxx will resize the win‐
                     dow to the size of the smallest session for which it is the current window,
                     rather than the smallest session to which it is attached.  The window may resize
                     when the current window is changed on another sessions; this option is good for
                     full-screen programs which support SIGWINCH and poor for interactive programs
                     such as shells.

                     ties.  The alternate screen feature preserves the contents of the window when an
                     interactive application starts and restores it on exit, so that any output visi‐
                     ble before the application starts reappears unchanged after it exits.  The
                     default is on.

MMOOUUSSEE SSUUPPPPOORRTT
     If the mmoouussee option is on (the default is off), ttmmuuxx allows mouse events to be bound as keys.
     The name of each key is made up of a mouse event (such as ‘MouseUp1’) and a location suffix (one
     of ‘Pane’ for the contents of a pane, ‘Border’ for a pane border or ‘Status’ for the status
     line).  The following mouse events are available:

           MouseDown1    MouseUp1      MouseDrag1
           MouseDown2    MouseUp2      MouseDrag2
           MouseDown3    MouseUp3      MouseDrag3
           WheelUp       WheelDown

     Each should be suffixed with a location, for example ‘MouseDown1Status’.

     The special token ‘{mouse}’ or ‘=’ may be used as _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w or _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e in commands bound
     to mouse key bindings.  It resolves to the window or pane over which the mouse event took place
     (for example, the window in the status line over which button 1 was released for a
     ‘MouseUp1Status’ binding, or the pane over which the wheel was scrolled for a ‘WheelDownPane’
     binding).

     The sseenndd--kkeeyyss --MM flag may be used to forward a mouse event to a pane.

     The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and resize panes, to copy text and
     to change window using the status line.  These take effect if the mmoouussee option is turned on.

FFOORRMMAATTSS
     Certain commands accept the --FF flag with a _f_o_r_m_a_t argument.  This is a string which controls the
     output format of the command.  Replacement variables are enclosed in ‘#{’ and ‘}’, for example
     ‘#{session_name}’.  The possible variables are listed in the table below, or the name of a ttmmuuxx
     option may be used for an option's value.  Some variables have a shorter alias such as ‘#S’, and
     ‘##’ is replaced by a single ‘#’.

     Conditionals are available by prefixing with ‘?’ and separating two alternatives with a comma; if
     the specified variable exists and is not zero, the first alternative is chosen, otherwise the
     second is used.  For example ‘#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}’ will include the string
     ‘attached’ if the session is attached and the string ‘not attached’ if it is unattached, or
     ‘#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}’ will include ‘yes’ if aauuttoommaattiicc--rreennaammee is enabled, or ‘no’ if not.
     A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefixing it by an ‘=’, a number
     and a colon, so ‘#{=10:pane_title}’ will include at most the first 10 characters of the pane
     title.

     In addition, the first line of a shell command's output may be inserted using ‘#()’.  For exam‐
     ple, ‘#(uptime)’ will insert the system's uptime.  When constructing formats, ttmmuuxx does not wait
     for ‘#()’ commands to finish; instead, the previous result from running the same command is used,
     or a placeholder if the command has not been run before.  Commands are executed with the ttmmuuxx
     global environment set (see the _E_N_V_I_R_O_N_M_E_N_T section).

     The following variables are available, where appropriate:

NNAAMMEESS AANNDD TTIITTLLEESS
     ttmmuuxx distinguishes between names and titles.  Windows and sessions have names, which may be used
     to specify them in targets and are displayed in the status line and various lists: the name is
     the ttmmuuxx identifier for a window or session.  Only panes have titles.  A pane's title is typi‐
     cally set by the program running inside the pane and is not modified by ttmmuuxx.  It is the same
     mechanism used to set for example the xterm(1) window title in an X(7) window manager.  Windows
     themselves do not have titles - a window's title is the title of its active pane.  ttmmuuxx itself
     may set the title of the terminal in which the client is running, see the sseett--ttiittlleess option.

     A session's name is set with the nneeww--sseessssiioonn and rreennaammee--sseessssiioonn commands.  A window's name is set
     with one of:

     1.      A command argument (such as --nn for nneeww--wwiinnddooww or nneeww--sseessssiioonn).

     2.      An escape sequence:

                   $ printf '\033kWINDOW_NAME\033\\'

     3.      Automatic renaming, which sets the name to the active command in the window's active
             pane.  See the aauuttoommaattiicc--rreennaammee option.

     When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.  A pane's title can be set via the OSC
     title setting sequence, for example:

           $ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     When the server is started, ttmmuuxx copies the environment into the _g_l_o_b_a_l _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t; in addition,
     each session has a _s_e_s_s_i_o_n _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t.  When a window is created, the session and global envi‐
     ronments are merged.  If a variable exists in both, the value from the session environment is
     used.  The result is the initial environment passed to the new process.

     The uuppddaattee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt session option may be used to update the session environment from the
     client when a new session is created or an old reattached.  ttmmuuxx also initialises the TMUX vari‐
     able with some internal information to allow commands to be executed from inside, and the TERM
     variable with the correct terminal setting of ‘screen’.

     Commands to alter and view the environment are:

     sseett--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt [--ggrruu] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n] _n_a_m_e [_v_a_l_u_e]
                   (alias: sseetteennvv)
             Set or unset an environment variable.  If --gg is used, the change is made in the global
             environment; otherwise, it is applied to the session environment for _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n.  The
             --uu flag unsets a variable.  --rr indicates the variable is to be removed from the environ‐
             ment before starting a new process.

     sshhooww--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt [--ggss] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n] [_v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e]
                   (alias: sshhoowweennvv)
             Display the environment for _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n or the global environment with --gg.  If
             _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e is omitted, all variables are shown.  Variables removed from the environment are
             prefixed with ‘-’.  If --ss is used, the output is formatted as a set of Bourne shell com‐
             mands.

SSTTAATTUUSS LLIINNEE
     ttmmuuxx includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom line of each terminal.  By
     default, the status line is enabled (it may be disabled with the ssttaattuuss session option) and con‐
     tains, from left-to-right: the name of the current session in square brackets; the window list;
     the title of the active pane in double quotes; and the time and date.

     The status line is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections (which may contain
     dynamic content such as the time or output from a shell command, see the ssttaattuuss--lleefftt,
     ssttaattuuss--lleefftt--lleennggtthh, ssttaattuuss--rriigghhtt, and ssttaattuuss--rriigghhtt--lleennggtthh options below), and a central window
     list.  By default, the window list shows the index, name and (if any) flag of the windows present
     in the current session in ascending numerical order.  It may be customised with the
     _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_s_t_a_t_u_s_-_f_o_r_m_a_t and _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_s_t_a_t_u_s_-_c_u_r_r_e_n_t_-_f_o_r_m_a_t options.  The flag is one of the following
     symbols appended to the window name:

           SSyymmbbooll    MMeeaanniinngg
           *         Denotes the current window.
           -         Marks the last window (previously selected).
           #         Window is monitored and activity has been detected.
           !         A bell has occurred in the window.
           ~         The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval.
           M         The window contains the marked pane.
           Z         The window's active pane is zoomed.

     The # symbol relates to the mmoonniittoorr--aaccttiivviittyy window option.  The window name is printed in
     inverted colours if an alert (bell, activity or silence) is present.

     The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the entire status line using the
     ssttaattuuss--ssttyyllee session option and individual windows using the wwiinnddooww--ssttaattuuss--ssttyyllee window option.

     The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the interval may be
     controlled with the ssttaattuuss--iinntteerrvvaall session option.

     Commands related to the status line are as follows:

     ccoommmmaanndd--pprroommpptt [--II _i_n_p_u_t_s] [--pp _p_r_o_m_p_t_s] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t] [_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e]
             Open the command prompt in a client.  This may be used from inside ttmmuuxx to execute com‐
             mands interactively.

             If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is specified, it is used as the command.  If present, --II is a comma-separated
             list of the initial text for each prompt.  If --pp is given, _p_r_o_m_p_t_s is a comma-separated
             list of prompts which are displayed in order; otherwise a single prompt is displayed,
             constructed from _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e if it is present, or ‘:’ if not.

             Both _i_n_p_u_t_s and _p_r_o_m_p_t_s may contain the special character sequences supported by the
             ssttaattuuss--lleefftt option.

             Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the string ‘%%’ and all occur‐
             rences of ‘%1’ are replaced by the response to the first prompt, the second ‘%%’ and all
             ‘%2’ are replaced with the response to the second prompt, and so on for further prompts.
             Up to nine prompt responses may be replaced (‘%1’ to ‘%9’).

BBUUFFFFEERRSS
     ttmmuuxx maintains a set of named _p_a_s_t_e _b_u_f_f_e_r_s.  Each buffer may be either explicitly or automati‐
     cally named.  Explicitly named buffers are named when created with the sseett--bbuuffffeerr or llooaadd--bbuuffffeerr
     commands, or by renaming an automatically named buffer with sseett--bbuuffffeerr --nn.  Automatically named
     buffers are given a name such as ‘buffer0001’, ‘buffer0002’ and so on.  When the bbuuffffeerr--lliimmiitt
     option is reached, the oldest automatically named buffer is deleted.  Explicitly named are not
     subject to bbuuffffeerr--lliimmiitt and may be deleted with ddeelleettee--bbuuffffeerr command.

     Buffers may be added using ccooppyy--mmooddee or the sseett--bbuuffffeerr and llooaadd--bbuuffffeerr commands, and pasted into
     a window using the ppaassttee--bbuuffffeerr command.  If a buffer command is used and no buffer is specified,
     the most recently added automatically named buffer is assumed.

     A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.  By default, up to 2000 lines
     are kept; this can be altered with the hhiissttoorryy--lliimmiitt option (see the sseett--ooppttiioonn command above).

     The buffer commands are as follows:

     cchhoooossee--bbuuffffeerr [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w] [_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e]
             Put a window into buffer choice mode, where a buffer may be chosen interactively from a
             list.  After a buffer is selected, ‘%%’ is replaced by the buffer name in _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e and
             the result executed as a command.  If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is not given, "paste-buffer -b '%%'" is
             used.  For the meaning of the --FF flag, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section.  This command works only
             if at least one client is attached.

             Delete the buffer named _b_u_f_f_e_r_-_n_a_m_e, or the most recently added automatically named buf‐
             fer if not specified.

                   (alias: ppaasstteebb)
             Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified pane.  If not specified, paste
             into the current one.  With --dd, also delete the paste buffer.  When output, any linefeed
             (LF) characters in the paste buffer are replaced with a separator, by default carriage
             return (CR).  A custom separator may be specified using the --ss flag.  The --rr flag means
             to do no replacement (equivalent to a separator of LF).  If --pp is specified, paste
             bracket control codes are inserted around the buffer if the application has requested
             bracketed paste mode.

             Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to _p_a_t_h.  The --aa option appends to rather
             than overwriting the file.

             Set the contents of the specified buffer to _d_a_t_a.  The --aa option appends to rather than
             overwriting the buffer.  The --nn option renames the buffer to _n_e_w_-_b_u_f_f_e_r_-_n_a_m_e.

             Display the contents of the specified buffer.

MMIISSCCEELLLLAANNEEOOUUSS
     Miscellaneous commands are as follows:

     cclloocckk--mmooddee [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e]

                   (alias: iiff)
             Execute the first _c_o_m_m_a_n_d if _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d returns success or the second _c_o_m_m_a_n_d other‐
             wise.  Before being executed, _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d is expanded using the rules specified in the
             _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section, including those relevant to _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e.  With --bb, _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d is run
             in the background.

             If --FF is given, _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d is not executed but considered success if neither empty nor
             zero (after formats are expanded).

     lloocckk--sseerrvveerr
                   (alias: lloocckk)
             Lock each client individually by running the command specified by the lloocckk--ccoommmmaanndd
             option.

                   (alias: rruunn)
             Execute _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d in the background without creating a window.  Before being exe‐
             cuted, shell-command is expanded using the rules specified in the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section.  With
             --bb, the command is run in the background.  After it finishes, any output to stdout is
             displayed in copy mode (in the pane specified by --tt or the current pane if omitted).  If
             the command doesn't return success, the exit status is also displayed.

     wwaaiitt--ffoorr [--LL | --SS | --UU] _c_h_a_n_n_e_l
                   (alias: wwaaiitt)
             When used without options, prevents the client from exiting until woken using wwaaiitt--ffoorr --SS
             with the same channel.  When --LL is used, the channel is locked and any clients that try
             to lock the same channel are made to wait until the channel is unlocked with wwaaiitt--ffoorr --UU.
             This command only works from outside ttmmuuxx.

TTEERRMMIINNFFOO EEXXTTEENNSSIIOONNSS
     ttmmuuxx understands some extensions to terminfo(5):

     _C_s, _C_r  Set the cursor colour.  The first takes a single string argument and is used to set the
             colour; the second takes no arguments and restores the default cursor colour.  If set, a
             sequence such as this may be used to change the cursor colour from inside ttmmuuxx:

                   $ printf '\033]12;red\033\\'

     _S_s, _S_e  Set or reset the cursor style.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the
             cursor to an underline:

                   $ printf '\033[4 q'

             If _S_e is not set, Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the cursor style instead.

     _M_s      This sequence can be used by ttmmuuxx to store the current buffer in the host terminal's
             selection (clipboard).  See the _s_e_t_-_c_l_i_p_b_o_a_r_d option above and the xterm(1) man page.

CCOONNTTRROOLL MMOODDEE
     ttmmuuxx offers a textual interface called _c_o_n_t_r_o_l _m_o_d_e.  This allows applications to communicate
     with ttmmuuxx using a simple text-only protocol.

     In control mode, a client sends ttmmuuxx commands or command sequences terminated by newlines on
     standard input.  Each command will produce one block of output on standard output.  An output
     block consists of a _%_b_e_g_i_n line followed by the output (which may be empty).  The output block
     ends with a _%_e_n_d or _%_e_r_r_o_r.  _%_b_e_g_i_n and matching _%_e_n_d or _%_e_r_r_o_r have two arguments: an integer
     time (as seconds from epoch) and command number.  For example:

           %begin 1363006971 2
           0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
           %end 1363006971 2

     In control mode, ttmmuuxx outputs notifications.  A notification will never occur inside an output
     block.

     The following notifications are defined:

     %%eexxiitt [_r_e_a_s_o_n]
             The ttmmuuxx client is exiting immediately, either because it is not attached to any session
             or an error occurred.  If present, _r_e_a_s_o_n describes why the client exited.

             The layout of a window with ID _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_i_d changed.  The new layout is _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_l_a_y_o_u_t.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     To create a new ttmmuuxx session running vi(1):

           $ tmux new-session vi

     Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.  For new-session, this is nneeww:

           $ tmux new vi

     Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is accepted.  If there are several
     options, they are listed:

           $ tmux n
           ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window

     Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing ‘C-b c’ (Ctrl followed by the ‘b’
     key followed by the ‘c’ key).

     Windows may be navigated with: ‘C-b 0’ (to select window 0), ‘C-b 1’ (to select window 1), and so
     on; ‘C-b n’ to select the next window; and ‘C-b p’ to select the previous window.

     A session may be detached using ‘C-b d’ (or by an external event such as ssh(1) disconnection)
     and reattached with:

           $ tmux attach-session

     Typing ‘C-b ?’ lists the current key bindings in the current window; up and down may be used to
     navigate the list or ‘q’ to exit from it.

     Commands to be run when the ttmmuuxx server is started may be placed in the _~_/_._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f configura‐
     tion file.  Common examples include:

     Changing the default prefix key:

           set-option -g prefix C-a
           unbind-key C-b
           bind-key C-a send-prefix

     Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:

           set-option -g status off
           set-option -g status-style bg=blue

     Setting other options, such as the default command, or locking after 30 minutes of inactivity:

           set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
           set-option -g lock-after-time 1800

     Creating new key bindings:

           bind-key b set-option status
           bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
           bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
